## ðŸ–‹ Reflection  

The main objective of this application was to **connect people with diverse skills to collaborate on interdisciplinary projects** while also exploring and adapting to technologies such as **Angular and Firebase**.  

The development process posed several challenges. Navigation and authentication required implementing access restrictions to prevent users without accounts from entering restricted sections. Real-time messaging was another major challenge, which was solved by creating a Firestore collection to store messages while tracking user interactions within each chat. Thanks to Firebase integration, the application efficiently handled authentication and data storage, enabling **rapid development without the need to build a database from scratch**.
